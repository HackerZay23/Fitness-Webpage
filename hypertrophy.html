            <p> What HyperTrophy Training focus mainly on is the development of your muscles as it increases the size of your muscle fibers <br>
                                            This type of training focuses more on moderate weight and moderate repetitions 
                                        </p>

                <h1> Mechanisms </h1>
                <li> During eccentric activity, the contractile elements(actin and myosin) in working muscles exert resistance <br> action that produces small tears in both the contractile elements and surface membrane of the associated muscle fibers <br> the muscle recovers and strengthens the tissue </li>
                <li> Metabolic stress results from the buildup of various metabolites primarily because training in the fast glycolytic <br> areas are used anaerobically to fuel performance </li>
                <li> Mechanical tension, means the force within the muscle fibers and the reaction increases protein synthesis and muscle size </li>
                <li> Fascia stretch Training, pumping the oxygenated blood in a relatively short period of time, this packs nutrient <br> and oxygen rich blood into and around the muscle cells to promote repair and growth</li>

                <button>
                <h1> Schedule </h1>
                <li> 3 days a week: In this schedule , you should lift heavy weights, by doing 3 days a week, you provide your body <br>
                time to rest as recovery is crucial for muscle growth <br> </li>
                 <li>2 days a week: this is dependent on your current fitness level<br></li>
                <li> Alternation: meaning, you alternate between your upper body and lower body on different days, as it provides time <br>
                and recovery for your muscles.<br></li>

            <h1> Tips:</h1>
            <li> <bolder> Use a reps-rest cycle</bolder> Research shows that weightlifters should aim for 6-12 reps per set. Allow 60-90 seconds <br> 
            between sets for rest. This will help achieve hypertrophy because your muscles will be fatigued</li>
            <li>Don't lift a weight thats too light, as that won't allow you to see the same gain of defintion</li>
            <li><bolder>Very your exercise or activites: </bolder></li>     
            <li> <bolder> Consider working with a trainer: A certified trainer can help you create a weight lifting program to meet your goals </bolder></li>
